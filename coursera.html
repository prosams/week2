<h2>COURSERA</h2>
<p>In 2015 I launched a 5 course specialization for Coursera - "Web Design for Everybody" (Basics of Web Development and Coding) Specialization. This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Learning about this range of technologies will get you started on the path of learning how to develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers accessible. I introduce the idea of accessible design for a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments.
</p>

My motivation for creating this course content was to spread the mission of free education to everyone. Unfortunately, many of the platform changes has put the material behind paywells. I highly encourage students to take the courses individually (rather than as a specialization) to access them for free. Even then, some of the assignments may be hidden. I am hoping to launch a new more open version in Fall 2018.

Because there are so many students it is absolutely impossible for me to answer email or become Facebook friends with students. Coursera has set up the platform that students can get help through the forums. I realize that you may not get help the first or second time you post for assistance, but it will come!! Please make sure to help your fellow students at the same time as well.
